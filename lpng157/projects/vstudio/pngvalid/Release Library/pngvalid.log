  Gamma correction error summary
  
  The printed value is the maximum error in the pixel values
  calculated by the libpng gamma correction code.  The error
  is calculated as the difference between the output pixel
  value (always an integer) and the ideal value from the
  libpng specification (typically not an integer).
  
  Expect this value to be less than .5 for 8 bit formats,
  less than 1 for formats with fewer than 8 bits and a small
  number (typically less than 5) for the 16 bit formats.
  For performance reasons the value for 16 bit formats
  increases when the image file includes an sBIT chunk.
